class RasterDataPlotter(builtins.object)
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, path)
 |      Class of raster for plotting
 |      :param path: string, path of the raster to be plotted
 |  
 |  make_hist(self, legendx, legendy, fontsize, output_file, figsize, set_ylim=None, set_xlim=None)
 |      Create a histogram of numerical raster
 |      :param legendx: string, legend of the x axis of he histogram
 |      :param legendy: string, legend of the y axis of he histogram
 |      :param fontsize: integer, size of the font
 |      :param output_file: string, path for the output file
 |      :param figsize: tuple of integers, size of the width x height of the figure
 |      :param set_ylim: float, set the maximum limit of the y axis
 |      :param set_ylim: float, set the maximum limit of the x axis
 |      :output: saves the figure of the histogram
 |  
 |  plot_categorical_raster(self, output_file, labels, cmap, box=True)
 |      Create a figure of a categorical raster
 |      :param output_file: path, file path of the figure
 |      :param labels: list of strings, labels (i.e., titles)for the categories
 |      :param cmap: string, colormap to plot the raster
 |      :param box: boolean, if False it sets off the frame of the picture
 |      :output: saves the figure of the raster
 |  
 |  plot_categorical_w_window(self, output_file, labels, cmap, xy, width, height, box=True)
 |      Create a figure of a categorical raster with a zoomed window
 |      :param output_file: path, file path of the figure
 |      :param labels: list of strings, labels (i.e., titles)for the categories
 |      :param cmap: string, colormap to plot the raster
 |      :param xy: tuple (x,y), origin of the zoomed window, the upper left corner
 |      :param width: integer, width (number of cells) of the zoomed window
 |      :param height: integer, height (number of cells) of the zoomed window
 |      :output: saves the figure of the raster
 |  
 |  plot_continuous_raster(self, output_file, cmap, vmax=nan, vmin=nan, box=True)
 |      Create a figure of a continuous valued raster
 |      :param output_file: path, file path of the figure
 |      :param cmap: string, colormap to plot the raster
 |      :param vmax: float, optional, value maximum of the scale, this value is used in the normalization of the colormap
 |      :param vmin: float, optional, value minimum of the scale, this value is used in the normalization of the colormap
 |      :param box: boolean, if False it sets off the frame of the picture
 |      :output: saves the figure of the raster
 |  
 |  plot_continuous_w_window(self, output_file, xy, width, height, bounds, cmap=None, list_colors=None)
 |      Create a figure of a raster with a zoomed window
 |      :param output_file: path, file path of the figure
 |      :param xy: tuple (x,y), origin of the zoomed window, the upper left corner
 |      :param width: integer, width (number of cells) of the zoomed window
 |      :param height: integer, height (number of cells) of the zoomed window
 |      :param bounds: list of float, limits for each color of the colormap
 |      :param cmap: string, optional, colormap to plot the raster
 |      :param list_colors: list of colors (str), optional, as alternative to using a colormap
 |      :output: saves the figure of the raster
